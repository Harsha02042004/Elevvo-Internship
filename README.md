**Task 1: Student Score Prediction Description:**
- Dataset (Recommended): Student Performance Factors [(Kaggle) ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors/data)
- Build a model to predict students' exam scores based on their study hours
- Perform data cleaning and basic visualization to understand the dataset 
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets 
- Train a linear regression model to estimate final scores 
- Visualize predictions and evaluate model performance

**Task 2: Customer Segmentation Description:**
- Dataset (Recommended): Mall Customer [(Kaggle) ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- Cluster customers into segments based on income and spending score
- Perform scaling and visual exploration of groupings
- Apply K-Means clustering and determine optimal number of clusters
- Visualize clusters using 2D plots

**Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification Description**
- Dataset (Recommended): Covertype [(UCI) ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset) 
- Predict the type of forest cover based on cartographic and environmental features
- Clean and preprocess the data including categorical handling
- Train and evaluate multi-class classification models
- Visualize confusion matrix and feature importance

**Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction Description**
- Dataset (Recommended): Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset [(Kaggle) ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset)
- Build a model to predict whether a loan application will be approved
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features
- Train a classification model and evaluate performance on imbalanced data
- Focus on precision, recall, and F1-score
